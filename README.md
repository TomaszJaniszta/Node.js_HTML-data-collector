# HTML-data-collector

Sample application for collecting data from the site. 
As an example, the olx portal, with chosen category of cars. 
The application collects specific data of all vehicles of this brand from the portal.
As the simplest throttling, I used a delay between downloading data from subpages.
The console prints out the progress of the data retrieval.
Api (server imitation) saves the collected data in a data.json file.
